<p>Update #1 on November 17th, 2017:</p>

<p>I just duplicated a game link and had it go to this update log instead it was really easy lol.</p>

<p>-This Web Page was unused for quite a while i am sorry, Fast Forward A Month-</p>
<p>All Updates on December 4th, 2017:</p>
<p>I added advertisments to the website.</p>
<p>Some people strongly dislike this, but it was needed to keep the website alive &amp; updated.</p>
<p>Next, i added an anti adblock to make sure we can get enough revenue to continue existing.</p>
<p>The anti-adblock did not work very well at all, so i just replaced it with a custom one and it seems much better and i still have to test it. At the time of this update coming out it has been tested, and i will give you an update if it did not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[EDIT] This worked&nbsp;<strong>FLAWLESSLY!&nbsp;</strong>It took a second to activate but after that, it started to work!!</p>

<p>Update #1 on December 5th, 2017: </p>
<p>I just found out google ads take like a week to be approved, oh well. So going one week without revenue, That's Totally fine.</p>
<p>NO THIS DOES NOT MEAN I WILL DISABLE THE ANTI ADBLOCKER OKAY?????</p>
<p><strong>P.S. I removed it anyway, while i fix some things</strong></p>
<p>Update #2 on December 6th, 2017: </p>
<p>Big Update coming, it might be a major fail. It's worth a shot though.</p>
<p>Nobody will really notice it though, hopefully not</p>
<p>It will be big, That's for sure. The problem really is if it will backwards compatible with the old counterparts...</p>
